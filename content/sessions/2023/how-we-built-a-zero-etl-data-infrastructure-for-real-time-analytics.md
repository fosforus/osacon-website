Kenobi is a real-time analytics platform which can ingest JSONs and without any manual intervention for data schema definition or data modelling, enables anyone to create metrics and aggregations on the data.
 
 
 
 This enables teams to use logs and system-generated events directly without needing to pre-process the data to make them useable.
 
 
 
 In this talk, we'll discuss the challenges in creating the dynamic transformation layer and the pros/cons associated with the approach.
