Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CICD) pipelines are crucial for deploying efficient and reliable data transformations. In this session we will answer the question "DIY or DIWhy?", where we will help you decide if you should build your own CICD pipelines for deploying your dbt project, or if you should use dbt Cloud's out of the box solutions.
 
 
 
 We'll examine the benefits and challenges of building your own pipeline with dbt Core, including flexibility and customization options, but also the need for more infrastructure and maintenance. We'll also explore the advantages and limitations of using dbt Cloud, including ease of use and less overhead, but less control and customization. Specifically, we will focus on two aspects of CICD:
 
  - Slim CI
 
  - Documentation Deployment
 
 
 
 By the end of this session, attendees will have a better understanding of which option may be best suited for their organization's specific needs and goals.
