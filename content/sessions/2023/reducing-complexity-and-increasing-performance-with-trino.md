In this talk, we'll be providing a quick overview of and then a longer update on Trino, the lightning-fast distributed SQL query and federation engine. Trino has been a prominent force in the open source data stack for over a decade, and development on it is as active as ever. It serves a multitude of data sources and has more clients supporting it than ever before. With exciting features such as table procedures (including a tool to automatically migrate from Hive to Iceberg), polymorphic table functions, and modern SQL features like MERGE, there's a lot going on in Trino that you may not know about if you haven't been paying close attention recently. This talk will be a project report as well as a roadmap of some exciting things to come, and we're excited to share Trino with the OSA CON audience.
