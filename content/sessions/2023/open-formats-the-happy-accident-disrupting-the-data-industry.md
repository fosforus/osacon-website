Analytic databases are quietly going through an unprecedented transformation. Open table formats, led by Apache Iceberg, enable multiple query engines to share one central copy of a table. This will fundamentally change the data industry, by freeing data thatâ€™s being held hostage by siloed data vendors.
 
 
 
 This session will cover the origins and basics of open table formats and show how new capabilities are shaping the future of both open source compute projects and commercial data warehouses alike. It will include key advice for building data architecture that makes data more accessible and useful while avoiding vendor lock-in.
