Data professionals and analysts are constantly searching for efficient ways to streamline their ETL/ELT processes. dbt, with its focus on transformation, modeling, and testing, has gained significant traction in the industry. On the other hand, DuckDB, a high-performance analytical database, has gained recognition for its speed and versatility.
