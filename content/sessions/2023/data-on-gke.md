Kubernetes was mostly associated with stateless applications such as web and batch applications. However, like most things, Kubernetes is constantly evolving. These days, we are seeing an exponential increase in the number of stateful apps on Kubernetes. In fact, the number of clusters running stateful apps on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has doubled every year since 2019. 

Learn how today, Kubernetes is increasingly used to run stateful and data applications such as databases (Kafka, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB), big data (Hadoop and Spark), data analytics (Hive and Pig), and machine learning (TensorFlow and PyTorch). Modern data engineering tools like Airbyte and vector DBs, and feature stores such as Qdrant, Weaviate and Feast, use containers and Kubernetes as their default self-managed compute deployment option.
