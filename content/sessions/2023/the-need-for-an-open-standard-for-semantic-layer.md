Join Brian Bickell, Cube's VP of Strategy and Alliances, as he proposes an open standard for the semantic layer, uniting BI tools, embedded analytics, and AI agents. 
 
Using an open standard will bring together data, enabling data tools to introspect data model definitions and seamlessly interoperate within the data stack.
 
By embracing this new approachâ€”data practitioners will reap the benefits with enhanced user experiences, quicker data delivery, and streamlined workloads. 
 
Tune in to hear how an open standard can harmonize your data tools to drive maximum impact for yourself and end-users.
