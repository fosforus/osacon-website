Developer communities express love through grey-hatting. It’s gentle and well-meaning, but it’s grey-hatting: passionate devs delight in uncovering vulnerabilities, bugs, and unexpected edge cases within your creations. The twist: they won't stop at just code; they'll also grey-hat your governance policies and community norms.
 
 
 
 In this talk, we'll explore the way these actions signify a deep love and engagement for the tools and frameworks you're building for them. We'll reveal the secret to harnessing this unique form of affection and guide you on how to reward it when it's positive, and skillfully redirect it when it's not.
 
 
 
 Join us to discover how embracing the grey-hats can lead to a stronger, more resilient community, and learn practical strategies for nurturing their passion while ensuring the security and stability of your open source projects.
