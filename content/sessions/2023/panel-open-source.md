Open source licenses are a linchpin of the free and open source software movement. Join our panel of open source experts as we do our yearly check-on the state of licenses. We'll talk about new developments in licensing this year (Terraform anyone?), revisit what a license actually does for your project, and talk about legal and moral issues when projects relicense. We'll even take questions from the crowd.
