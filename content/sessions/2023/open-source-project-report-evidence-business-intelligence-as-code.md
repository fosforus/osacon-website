Evidence is an open source business intelligence tool where all content is defined in markdown and SQL. This session will give an overview of the project: what it is, why we're building it, why we chose open source, and the upcoming roadmap. It will also include a look at the newest release, which introduces a client-side SQL runtime powered by DuckDB WebAssembly, interactive filters, and support for multiple data source connections including APIs.
