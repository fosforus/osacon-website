Quite often you hear about the "new" orchestrator that aims to solve your orchestration needs. You can also often hear how it compares to Airflow. However those comparisions often overlook the fact that since Airflow 2.0 has been introduced, it continues to evolve and piece-by-piece modernize itself.
 
New UI, new ways of writing your orchestration tasks, new ways to test them. And the comparision often overlook that if you start your journey with Airflow today, your experience will be quite a bit different than even 2 years ago (what usually most comparisions talk about). This talk will highlight some of the important ones. 

Also you might be surprised but this is all happening without breaking compatibility - hence you can still you use it in the "old way". But maybe it's time to learn new ways?
