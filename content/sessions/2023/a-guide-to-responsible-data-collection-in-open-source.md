Collecting usage data in open source can be a controversial topic, but attitudes on this topic have been notably shifting recently. After working with many open source projects and companies over the past 4 years, our team at Scarf has established empirically successful best practices and considerations that all open source projects should be aware of to effectively track the usage of their software.
