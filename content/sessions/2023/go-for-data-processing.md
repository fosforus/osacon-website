The traditional languages for data engineering include Python, Java and Scala, but in recent years there has also been some buzz around Go and Rust. This talk will introduce Go as a language for data processing and explain some of its unique features. It will show how to solve common data problems such as serialization and transformation, and demonstrate how to build an end-to-end data pipeline in Go.
