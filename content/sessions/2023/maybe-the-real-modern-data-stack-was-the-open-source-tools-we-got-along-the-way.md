There are many misconceptions of the Modern Data Stack, and it's easy to forget the real pain it solved and the value it unlocked. 
 
 
 
 While some people still view the Modern Data Stack as marketing-fluff, I'd like to demonstrate how powerful it can be by reclaiming it using Open Source tooling. 
 
 
 
 With tools like sling, dbt, duckdb, dagster, and more, we can spin up cost-effective, fast, and powerful ETL data stacks that would have taken months to implement in the past.
