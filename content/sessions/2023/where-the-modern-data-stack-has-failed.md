The "modern data stack" has been a big leap forward for data teams, but it is starting to tear at the seams. It is easy, but it does not scale data teams at demanding organization. Too many tools. Some are too heavy; some are too light. They are not composable or programmable enough, leaving data engineers with a unwieldy set of siloed toosl difficult to program, deploy, and manage in a cohesive fashion.
 
Nick will explain how we need to refocus on the data platform engineer and data engineerâ€™s needs to mature the modern data stack to its next, more exciting form. New engineering-centric tools like DuckDb, SDF, Iceberg, Dagster, Sling, Polars, and others comprise a modern data engineering stack, ready to reshape the data world.
