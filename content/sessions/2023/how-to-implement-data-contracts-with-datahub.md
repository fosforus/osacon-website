Data contracts have been much discussed in the community of late, with a lot of curiosity around how to approach this concept in practice. We believe data contracts need a harmonizing layer to manage data quality in a uniform manner across a fragmented stack. We are calling this harmonizing layer the Control Plane for Data - powered by the common thread across these systems: metadata. This talk will cover practical ways of implementing Data Contracts with DataHub, the most popular open source metadata platform.
