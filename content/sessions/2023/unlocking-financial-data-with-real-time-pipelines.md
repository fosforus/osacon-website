Financial institutions thrive on accurate and timely data to drive critical decision-making processes, risk assessments, and regulatory compliance. However, managing and processing vast amounts of financial data in real-time can be a daunting task. To overcome this challenge, modern data engineering solutions have emerged, combining powerful technologies like Apache Flink, Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka, and Iceberg to create efficient and reliable real-time data pipelines. In this talk, we will explore how this technology stack can unlock the full potential of financial data, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions swiftly and with confidence.
 
 Introduction: Financial institutions operate in a fast-paced environment where real-time access to accurate and reliable data is crucial. Traditional batch processing falls short when it comes to handling rapidly changing financial markets and responding to customer demands promptly. In this talk, we will delve into the power of real-time data pipelines, utilizing the strengths of Apache Flink, Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka, and Iceberg, to unlock the potential of financial data.
