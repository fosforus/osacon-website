Multi-table transactions have existed in data warehouses for some time, but with the open source Project Nessie, multi-table transactions and an innovative git-like experience become available to data lakehouses. In this session, learn how Project Nessie enables the new “Data as Code” paradigm allowing for workload isolation, multi-table transactions and experimentation when working with Apache Iceberg tables.
 
In this session you'll learn about the Data-as-code paradigm, what is the open source Project Nessie and the new patterns in data engineering it enables.
