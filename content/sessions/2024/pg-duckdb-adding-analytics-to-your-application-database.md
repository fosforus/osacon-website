PostgreSQL is the fastest growing open source transactional database. DuckDB is the fastest growing open source analytical one. pg_duckdb is a new Postgres extension that brings the two together, and lets you run analytical queries on your postgres instance, with the full performance of DuckDB. 
 
 
 
 This talk will show how to use pg_duckdb to do analytics over your application data, lakehouse data, and to scale it to the cloud via MotherDuck.
 
 
 
 The work is a joint effort from MotherDuck, Hydras, DuckDB Labs, Neon, and Microsoft that combines deep Postgres expertise from Hydras, Neon and Microsoft with the DuckDB know-how from DuckDB labs (the creators of DuckDB) and MotherDuck.
