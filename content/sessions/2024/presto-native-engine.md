Presto 2.0 is a full rewrite of the Presto query execution engine (https://prestodb.io/). The goal is to bring a 3-4x improvement in Presto performance and scalability by moving from the old Java implementation to a modern C++ one. This move towards native execution aligns with industry initiatives like Databricks Photon and Apache DataFusion, among others. We are very excited to bring this technology to Presto to make it the best Open Data Lakehouse engine in the market.

Presto 2.0 has been in active development for about 4 years and we have some production deployments at Meta and IBM now.
This project has a very active open-source community comprising engineers from Meta, Ahana/IBM, Uber, ByteDance, Pinterest, Intel, Neuroblade among others.

This session will give an overview of the project, its architecture and our experiences with launching this project at Meta and TPC-DS benchmarking at IBM watsonx.data (https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/delivering-superior-price-performance-and-enhanced-data-management-for-ai-with-ibm-watsonx-data/)
