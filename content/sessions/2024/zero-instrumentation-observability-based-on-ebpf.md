Observability is a critical aspect of any infrastructure as it enables teams to promptly identify and address issues. Nevertheless, achieving system observability comes with its own set of challenges. It is a time- and resource-intensive process as it necessitates the incorporation of instrumentation into every application.
 
 In this talk, we will delve into the gathering of telemetry data, including metrics, logs, and traces, using eBPF. We will explore tracking various container activities, such as network calls and filesystem operations. Additionally, we will discuss the effective utilization of this telemetry data for troubleshooting.
