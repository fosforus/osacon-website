This session is about the new major release of Airflow that we plan to release early in 2025. This is the first major release of Airflow since 2021 when we released Airflow 2 and it is a result of 4 years of improvements we've implemented as minor releases, but also a lot of listening to our users, and changing industry. While Airlfow remains the most important and strongest ETL/Data orchestrator in use, with the advent of LLM/GenAI becoming mainstream part of the data orchestration and a wealth of workflow and tooling specialising in those, Airflow 3 is aiming to become the only True Open-Source, Open-Governance Enterprise-level strong Orchestration solution for all your batch processing worfklow needs. This talk will tell about basic principles and plans we have that will make Airlfow even more suited for most of your data pipeline needs.
