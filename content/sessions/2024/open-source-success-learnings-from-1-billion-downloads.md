In this talk, we share the results of an in-depth analysis of data gathered from over 1 billion open source package downloads across more than 2000 diverse projects on Scarf. Our findings offer valuable insights into user behaviors and interactions with open source software, making it essential for maintainers, founders, and executives in open source companies.
 
 During the presentation, we delve deep into our data, uncovering the best practices employed by successful open source projects. We explore a wide array of topics, including various download formats, packaging systems, regional download trends, and user-favored documentation types. Additionally, we discuss the impact of community engagement and how maintainers can harness their user base to boost project adoption and drive business growth.
 
 Attendees can expect to leave this talk equipped with actionable insights and best practices to optimize their open source projects and thrive in the competitive landscape of open source software.
