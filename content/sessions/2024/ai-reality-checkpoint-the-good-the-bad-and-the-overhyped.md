In the past 18 months, artificial intelligence has not just entered our workspaces â€“ it has taken over. As we stand at the crossroads of innovation and automation, it's time for a candid reflection on how AI has reshaped our professional lives, and to talk about where it's been a game changer, where it's falling short, and what's about to shift dramatically in the short term.
 
Since the release of ChatGPT in December 2022, I've developed a "first-reflex" to augment and accelerate nearly every task with AI. As a founder and CEO, this spans a wide array of responsibilities from fundraising, internal communications, legal, operations, product marketing, finance, and beyond. In this keynote, I'll cover diverse use cases across all areas of business, offering a comprehensive view of AI's impact.
 
I've also been working closely with the data team at Preset, leveraging AI to assist and augment all aspects of data work. While I'll explore a broad spectrum of tasks beyond data, I'll delve deeper into the data-related aspects for as this facet of my work is most relevant to OSA CON attendees.
 
Join me as I sort out through this new reality and try and forecast the future of AI in our work. It's time for a radical checkpoint. Everything's changing fast. In some areas, AI has been a slam dunk; in others, it's been frustrating as hell. And once a few key challenges are tackled, we're on the cusp of a tsunami of transformation.
 
3 major milestones are right around the corner: top-human-level reasoning, solid memory accumulation and recall, and proper executive skills. How is this going to affect all of us?
