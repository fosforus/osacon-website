Data teams often have established workflows to access data from different sources, process, and analyze data, but can be stymied by the “last mile problem” in data: creating rich, fast, and fully customized apps and dashboards. Closed-source, GUI-based BI options pose challenges for data visualization developers, restricting them to pre-built data integrations, out-of-the-box chart components and layouts, and restricted publishing options.
 
Observable Framework is a new open-source static site generator, command line tool, and local preview server. It’s files-based, so integrates seamlessly into existing data workflows. Framework’s data loaders support back-end data processing in any programming language, bridging the gap between data teams and developers, and improving app performance. And, when working in Framework, everything is created with code, which means developers can build fully customized, interactive graphics and pages without constraints. 
 
In this talk we’ll share the scoop on Framework, highlighting features that can help developers get their data past the last mile, including:
 - Files-based and flexible: How Framework lets you use your existing skills and preferred tools to get quickly up-and-running with dashboard development.
 - Data loaders 101: What are they? Why are they a win for data teams, app performance, and decision-makers? And how can you write your own?
 - Code-based and fully customizable: What’s possible when you aren’t constrained by your BI tools.
