Great AI applications start with great data. While DuckDB and MotherDuck are rapidly gaining traction for open-source AI and data engineering, PyAirbyte provides seamless and reliable data movement—directly in Python. In this session, we’ll show you how to combine these powerful tools to build a scalable data hub for GenAI applications and analytics, getting started in just minutes. We’ll conclude by demonstrating how you can build your next GenAI app directly in the database, all on a foundation of great data.

Whether you’re new to data or a seasoned professional, you’ll discover how to harness Airbyte’s hundreds of open source data connectors—or even build your own—for a solution that’s approachable for hobby projects and proofs of concept, yet robust enough for large-scale applications.
