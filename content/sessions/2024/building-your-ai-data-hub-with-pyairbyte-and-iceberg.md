To provide great results, AI applications need access to great data. While Iceberg is quickly becoming the gold standard for cloud data storage, PyAirbyte makes it easy to reliably move data from anywhere to anywhere else, directly in Python. We'll show you how to combine these two tools and build a scalable data hub for GenAI applications and analytics - getting started in minutes building out your own AI data hub. Whether you are new to data lakes or an experienced veteran, we'll show you how to get data from any of Airbyte's hundreds of source connectors - or build your own - for a solution that is approachable for hobby projects and POCs, while at the same time robust enough for enterprise applications.
