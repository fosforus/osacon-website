As Argo Workflows and Argo Events continue to gain popularity for their powerful capabilities in event-driven automation and complex job orchestration, this presentation will delve into how we used this architecture to process millions of records daily.
 
You will gain insights into the specific architecture that integrates Argo Events and Argo Workflows to achieve efficient data aggregation and ingestion. We will discuss the challenges encountered during this process and share the strategies we employed to overcome these issues. Attendees will also learn how we use techniques like "Work avoidance" to ensure we don't redo the work.
