Kubernetes has changed everything. Not only the way we deploy our applications. But also how we monitor them, how we collect, store, visualize, and alert on time series data generated by monitoring systems. 
 
 What are the challenges in modern monitoring? Why have new-generation time series databases like VictoriaMetrics and Prometheus emerged? Why is there no SQL support in these databases? Why are Grafana dashboards so fancy? Join us as we explore these questions and many other questions related to the specifics of time series data analysis.
