Together with the local government of one of the biggest cantons in Switzerland, Bern, we created the fully open-source data plattform HelloDATA https://github.com/kanton-bern/hellodata-be
 
 
 
 We leveraged established open-source data tools such as Superset, DBT, Airflow and JupyterHub to create an integrated, "one-stop-shop" data platform. Using HelloDATA we are driving government agencies of all types to better understand and utilize their data and generate value for themselves and their citizens.
 
 
 
 In this session we would like to give insights into:
 
 -The platform and its functionalities
 
 -The process of developing, maintaining and improving HelloDATA
 
 -Our learnings and take-aways in creating such an open-source platform together with large scale government agencies
