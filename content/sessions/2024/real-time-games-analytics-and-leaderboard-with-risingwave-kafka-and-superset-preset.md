In this session, we will set up a real-time pipeline using Kafka, RisingWave, and Superset in Preset. We will ingest player-related data into a Kafka topic and configure RisingWave to consume this data, creating materialized views for real-time analysis. With RisingWave and Superset, we can generate real-time visual dashboards, set up alerts, and create reports, enabling us to monitor player performance, create real-time leaderboards, and analyze game trends in real-time.
