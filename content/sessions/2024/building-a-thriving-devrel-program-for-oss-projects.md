Over the years, we have seen a good number of OSS projects with great features and services go unnoticed and often get overshadowed by their proprietary counterparts. This highlights a key point: having a brilliant open-source project alone isn't enough. To truly grow an open source project, you need a vibrant developer community that uses, contributes to, and champions your project. 
 
In this session, we'll look at how to build a successful open source project through strategic DevRel practices. Drawing from my experience, I will discuss the synergy between open source development and developer relations (DevRel). We will look at how to achieve a welcoming and user-friendly experience for developers. We will also explore ways to track and evaluate the effectiveness of your DevRel efforts within open source projects.
