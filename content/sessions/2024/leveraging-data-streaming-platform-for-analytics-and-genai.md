Apache Kafka is becoming the standard for integrating all information within an enterprise. This provides an opportunity for each enterprise to take actions on what's happening in its business in real time. One common use case is to take this data and ingest it to a data lake for analytics. I will show that by integrating Kafka with Apache Iceberg can make analytics much easier. Another rising use case is GenAI. I will show how we have extended Apache Flink to support realtime inference with GenAI.
