In this lightning talk, Diptiman would present the techniques used to execute text-2-cypher analytical query generations with the help of modern large language models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 etc . This session will dive deep into Graph database querying and how LLMs assist developers get analytical queries executed on popular Graph databases like Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.
