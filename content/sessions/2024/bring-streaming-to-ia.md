As AI and machine learning become more integral to business operations and decision-making, the need for real-time data processing has never been more critical. Whether you're monitoring live streams from edge devices, responding to events as they happen, or managing data in distributed databases, the ability to process and act on data in real-time can be the difference between success and irrelevance.
 
In this talk, we'll showcase how connecting to real-time data sources can create more responsive and adaptive AI systems within the Python ecosystem, using Bytewax. We'll explore practical scenarios where this capability enhances insight and efficiency, particularly in the context of modern AI tools like LLM applications and RAG systems.
