Every company has a data platform, the systems and tools that produce data, They are critical to every modern business, and can incur massive cost and complexity. In this talk we argue that data platforms must be composable and flexible, and that necessitates a new skill: data platform engineering. We will then discuss how an advanced orchestrator and control plane is the essential technology to engineering a composable data platform, how in turn manage complexity, avoid vendor lock-in, enable end-to-end ownership for practitioner teams, and contain the costs of your data platform.
