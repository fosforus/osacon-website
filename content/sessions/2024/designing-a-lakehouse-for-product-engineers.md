Open Lakehouses are among the most transformative innovations in big data, celebrated widely within data communities. Yet, for most product engineers, the lakehouse is off the radar. In this talk, we introduce Mooncake Labs and our mission to bridge this gap—connecting applications seamlessly with lakehouse capabilities. We’ll also dive into our open-source project, pg_mooncake, which empowers developers to build and manage lakehouse tables directly from within PostgreSQL.
