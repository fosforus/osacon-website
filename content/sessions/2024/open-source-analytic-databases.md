Cloud data warehouses are the dominant life form for modern analytic systems. They work like restaurants where users visit to feed on data. Larger data sets, AI, and user decisions to keep information in their own data lakes are undermining the restaurant model. What we need now is food trucks that move anywhere users need them. The food truck metaphor helps us envision a powerful new analytic system: the real-time data lake.
