My name is Arjun Sharda and I am passionate about technology. Despite my young age of 13, I am already an entrepreneur, writer, full-stack developer, and YouTuber. I have been working on many open-source projects and have earned certifications from reputable institutions such as Stanford, Meta, Google, Amazon Web Services, and deeplearning.ai.
