I design systems of collaboration for companies that want to leverage open source in legally compliant, operationally secure, and technologically innovative ways. I do this by authentically connecting with people and working with them to build corporate cultures where engineers not only leverage the advantages of open source to build better products but also leave a legacy of impact for both people and planet.
