I have worked in the field of helping government agencies and other businesses accelerate their digital transformation for over 10 years.
 
 Starting as a product manager for secure e-mail and e-payment solutions at Swiss Post for over 5 years, I transitioned into the field of data management some years ago.
 
 Again as product manager I was heavily involved in creating and establishing the open-source data platform HelloDATA. As of right now I am responsible for scaling and developing our data management solutions at Bedag Solutions AG.
