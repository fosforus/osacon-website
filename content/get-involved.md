OSA CON needs you! We're looking for volunteers to make this the most successful OSA CON **ever**. [Join our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osacommunityworkspace/shared_invite/zt-2j5oq8pa9-3z2STvxxRsrzhYkPOMwX4A) and introduce yourself. Here are just a few of the ways you can assist:


 * Evangelize the conference in your communities, workplace, and social networks.
 * Organize IRL meetups in San Francisco, New York, or anywhere else to accompany the conference.
 * Serve as ambassadors during the conference itself to make OSA CON welcoming, interesting, and fun.
 * Serve as moderators for talks (limited slots).
 * Help us make OSA CON a year-round community for open source analytics software.


[Join Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osacommunityworkspace/shared_invite/zt-2j5oq8pa9-3z2STvxxRsrzhYkPOMwX4A) today or send email to help@osacon.io. We'll help you get connected with jobs. We're eager to meet you
